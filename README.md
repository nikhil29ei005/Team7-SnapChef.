## 📖 Project Overview
SnapChef is an intelligent web application designed to tackle the problem of food waste among students and bachelors. Instead of ordering takeout because you "have nothing to cook," SnapChef uses Google's advanced multimodal AI to analyze photos of your available ingredients and generate instant, healthy recipe ideas.

**Problem:** High food waste and poor nutrition among students due to a lack of cooking knowledge.
**Solution:** A "Snap & Cook" AI assistant that identifies ingredients, estimates nutrition (calories/protein), and acts as a personal chef.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **📸 Visual Recognition:** Identifies ingredients directly from raw images using **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**.
* **🥗 Smart Nutrition:** Estimates calorie and protein content to promote healthier eating.
* **⚡ Instant Recipes:** Generates step-by-step cooking instructions based *only* on what you have.
* **📱 Mobile Ready:** Designed for quick use on any device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Multimodal)
* **Development:** Google AI Studio (App Builder)
* **Platform:** Web Application
* **Theme:** Open Innovation

## ⚡ How to Test (Live MVP)
You do not need to install any code to test this application. We have deployed a live version via Google AI Studio.
